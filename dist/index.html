                How Stephen Antuna CRO at Reggora went from event-generated
                leads to a successful outbound outreach program.
              </h1>
              <p>
                The residential appraisal process can take weeks. In a world
                where we can hail a personal driver within minutes and track
                exactly how many blocks until our pizza arrives, why should the
                experience of getting an appraisal be any different? That’s
                where Reggora comes in.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >Reggora offers an All-In-One, free Appraisal Platform that
                  simplifies and shortens</strong
                >
                the entire appraisal workflow, from automatic order allocation
                to comprehensive quality control, all in a single platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means that mortgage lenders and appraisers can spend less
                time and money on tedious tasks and more time on appraising.
              </p>
              <p>
                “We’re shortening turn times, increasing transparency, and
                making the appraisal process easier and faster for everyone
                involved.”

                <p>
                  Traditionally, Reggora generated the vast majority of its
                  leads by attending industry conferences. This allowed them to
                  showcase their technology to large groups of potential
                  customers and it served them really well to drive interest and
                  awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, when COVID hit, and industry conferences, in-person
                  meetings, dinners, and various events came to a halt, Stephen
                  and his team had to urgently redefine their sales process in
                  order to survive the “new” marketplace dynamics.

                  The steps Reggora took to accomplished this goal centered
                  around looking at the building blocks they already had and
                  create on top of that a successful outbound outreach:
                </p>
                <h3>1. Adapt an outbound sales process:</h3>
                <p>
                  Initially, they were reaching out to their prospects mainly
                  via blast email, but other than that, they didn’t have enough
                  of a sales process that could generate the expected revenue.
                  So they added cold calling to their initial outbound outreach
                  to increase the number of sales conversations with prospective
                  customers and compensate for those inbound leads from
                  conferences that were no longer an option.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  2. Get really specific about the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):
                </h3>
